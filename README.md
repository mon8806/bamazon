# bamazon

## Project Overview

*  With node.js and mysql, we created a database where the user are asked a couple questions see what they want to buy.

*  To run the app, the user will input node bamazonCustomer.js in the terminal.  A table will display info of things that are for sell.  The user is asked 2 questions; what they want to buy and how many.  If user input a quantity that is more than what is in stock, they will receive a message saying there isn't enough in stock.  But if they input an amount that less than the quantity than they will get the total cost and the database will be updated with the amount they bought.
